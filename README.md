# GazaPlaces
This android application helps in locating all places of Gaza Strip such as restaurants, shops and medical clinics.
It also helps determine the location on the map using Google Maps, and provides means to communicate with the owners of the place.

I used the following in this app:

- Kotlin.
- Google maps and locations.
- Firebase Cloud Firestore as database.
- Designe pattern (MVVM) and live data
- Firebase Storage For save images.
- View binding.
- Dependancy Injection (Hilt).
- Firebase Cloud Messaging.
